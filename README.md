# Raspberry PI Touch Calendar

This repository holds the electron application that I have created for use with our family,
it is a small and simple application, but something that will be fun to setup and use
at our home.  If you like it, feel free to enjoy or adjust to fit your own needs.

## Approaches to learn

This is going to be a fun project as there are a few items that I am going to focus on as
part of this process, namely the following:

* Electron for gui development
* A nix flake for the development and package (`dream2nix` to start)
* Refresher on typescript
* jujitsu for the vcs tool
